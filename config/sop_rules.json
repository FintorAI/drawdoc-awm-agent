Encompass >> Borrower Information – Vesting Form Docs Team will verify the Borrower(s) vesting with Processor on Slack or through vesting task which is done by Processing. Docs Team to ensure it is updated correctly. If there is a change in Vesting identified at Docs stage then update the vesting information in Encompass matches with 1003 form and Title report.

REMARKS FOR COLORADO STATE: If Property is located in Colorado State then Marital status is not required to update under Borrower’s vesting. Only Borrower / Co-Borrower’s name will be updated as vesting.",
    "Texas law for Vesting:": "On Texas properties the Deed of Trust need not be drafted with additional verbiage like “Joint tenants” or “Joint tenants with rights of survivor ship” prior to sending it for Attorney review.",
    "Attorney’s policy is to reference only the borrowers’ marital status in the vesting clause for Texas closings.  The reasons for our policy are:": "The borrowers’ marital status will determine whether a spouse’s signature is required on the Deed of Trust to create a valid lien on homestead under Texas law Adding the verbiage “Joint Tenants with Rights of Survivorship”, alone, is insufficient under Texas law to create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship.  The borrowers must enter into a separate “Survivorship Agreement” pursuant to the Texas Estates Code in order to create a joint tenancy with right of survivorship Creating a joint tenancy with right of survivorship is contrary to the common practice in Texas, and may impact the borrowers’ estate planning objectives without their knowledge The manner in which title is held by the borrowers has no impact on the validity of the lien created by the Deed of Trust. If the Processor has updated vesting with Joint Tenancy verbiage, Doc drawer will update it as per Attorney policy in Encompass **REMARKS – UPDATE 01/03/18** - Docs Draw team need to confirm below points when property is under Texas state and transaction is Cash out Refinance with Primary Occupancy i.e Texas Home Equity Notice Concerning Extensions of Credit (12 Day Notice) – A Texas Equity loan may not be closed before the 12th calendar day after the later of (i) loan application date on Initial 1003 or (ii) the date Buyer signs the Notice Concerning Extensions of Credit disclosure.

Encompass >> Tools >> File Contacts >> Hazard Insurance Hazard Insurance section Verify all fields with reference to the HOI(EOI) policy & paid receipt(invoice). Agents Name and Email canbe Blank if no information is provided on HOI. Insufficient coverage/dwelling: HARDSTOP. Reach out to processor and request for to provide updated HOI with sufficient coverage. To determine coverage amount, locate Dwelling amount and add any replacement cost to it. Total of these two figures equals your total Dwelling coverage. Evidence of Insurance >> Coverage Section Example: (Dwelling) $206,000 + 125% (Replacement Cost) = Total Coverage of $257,500 which should cover the total loan amount. Please IMP note that “Building Ordinance or Law Coverage” should not be considered towards additional replacement cost. **REMARKS** - HOI Master Policy – If Master policy doesn’t shows Property address, Borrower name or loss payee. Step-1 – Docs team to check if there is any PTF / PTD Condition added by UW or not. If Condition is added by UW, Docs team will proceed for the Docs. Step-2 – If PTF / PTD Conditions are not updated in direct then reach out to processor for the same to provide updated master policy and add PTF Condition in Direct as, “Processor to provide Updated Master policy showing Borrower name / Property address / Loss payee name (All Western Mortgage) and loan number” Step – 3–Docs team will not hold the Docs for incomplete master policy. They will proceed with the Docs drawing with applicable PTF in direct and request it to the processor on Slack to provide it prior to funding. How to verify the insurance company details from the Evidence of Insurance(EOI) Ex:$471,000(Dwelling coverage on HOI)X125%ERC (if given)=$588,750. This result should be equal to or more than loan amount to proceed with Docs Request.(If the EOI shows a Guaranteed Replacement Cost “GRC”, then total loan amount will be considered as Coverage) Dwelling Coverage should be equal or greater than loan amount If Dwelling calculated above is not enough to cover loan amount then check the estimated cost of Appraisal on Appraisal Report. If coverage is greater than estimated cost then we are good, else reach out to Processor for Insufficient Dwelling and Hold DOCS drawing request. This is the place where you can locate “Total estimate of cost of appraisal” from page-3 of Appraisal report, NOTES: For MH Property Transactions, Check below snap From Appraisal report page-2 to identify Replacement cost calculation on Appraisal as it will be located differently. On Purchase Transaction, HOI term must be effective from the month file is closing. Verify Mortgagee Clause on Evidence of Insurance. Mortgagee name has to be read Lender name as“ALL WESTERN MORTGAGE, INC” with Lender address and AWM Loan #. If there is any discrepancy in this date, reach out to processor for correction in Mortgagee clause. Evidence of Insurance **REMARKS** - We do not require Dwelling Coverage to be sufficient on HO6 Policy to cover 20% of appraised value as per FNMA guideline . REMEMBER – This is only for Conventional Condo loans having master policy and HO6 with it. We are okay and can proceed if Coverage is not sufficient on HO6 policy. Flood Insurance – (if property is in Flood Zone) – Docs team to update highlighted Information from attached Flood Insurance policy.

Max Allowable Coverage limit on Flood Insurance is $250k. If loan amount is greater than $250k- Max coverage on Flood Insurance to be $250K If loan amount is less than $250k – Ensure the Dwelling coverage on flood insurance covers at least the loan amount. If Flood Zone and NFIP MAP number from Flood certificate doesn’t match either with Flood Insurance or Appraisal report then PTF as below & proceed with Doc’s, “UTR – Correct Flood Map # on appraisal report/flood insurance to match Flood Certificate” “UTR – Correct Flood zone on appraisal report/flood insurance to match FloodCertificate” Appraisal report\t\t\t\tFlood Certificate\t\tFlood Insurance REMARKS: If property is Condo & in Flood zone and there is no HO6 available for Flood insurance then Docs draw to verify whether Master policy is combined with Hazard and Wind (flood) or not.

Update on Non-Borrowing Spouse(NBS) Requirement: In community property states, on *Refinance Primary – rescindable transactions*, the NBS must sign/acknowledge the CD’s, sign the NORTC and sign the security instrument. If a QCD has already been executed and recorded, and vesting shows sole and separate, then the NORTC and the security instrument need NOT to be signed by the NBS. A copy of the QCD must be identified on the prelim or a copy retained in our file. **IMP NOTES** - We have compliance confirmation that if there is a NBS that will NOT be on title (executing a QCD) to the subject property then the NBS does NOT need to sign/acknowledge the CD as the NBS is not considered a consumer on the transaction.So, the only time a NBS in a community property state needs to acknowledge the CD is if the NBS is going to be on title to the subject property. In Addition, If NBS name is not updated on Title report vesting in community states but now he/she is signing as Title only on DOCS, we still do not require NBS to sign the Initial CD. If NBS is vested in Title report and if he/she is signing as title only then signature must required for Initial CD by NBS.

It will not automatically cutoff at 78%. What you will do is, remove 78% Cutoff (Cancel At) from Mortgage Insurance section When Number of Units are 2 or more than that. Remember – Cutoff 78% (Cancel At) is only to remove when Number of Units are equal to 2 or greater. If it is “1” unit then we will keep 78% cut off on MI Section on Conventional loans with 80% above LTV.

Remember – If there is an appraisal report in the file on FHA refinance loan then value in Encompass has to match with Appraisal report. It is fine if Refinance Authorization has old value in that case. If Appraisal is waived on FHA Streamline without Appraisal – In that case, Origination value on Refinance Authorization must match with Encompass and Approval Final. Update on Random fees restriction on Lender fee Section – A – Effective immediately, if in section 800 there are any random fees added by Processor apart from UNDERWRITING FEE & PROCESSING FEE, those files must be brought to Team lead or Manager’s notice. File won’t leave the queue without lead’s approval.
