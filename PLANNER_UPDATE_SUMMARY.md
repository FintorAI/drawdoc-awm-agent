# Planner and Test Data Updates - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

Successfully updated the DrawDoc-AWM agent to include:
1. **Testing capabilities in the planner** - Agent can now run tests when asked
2. **Hardcoded test data** - Known working values stored as constants outside the planner
3. **Updated planner prompt** - Includes Encompass tools and testing workflows

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated `planner_prompt.md`

**Added Sections:**

**Encompass Tools Documentation:**
- `read_loan_fields` - Read field values from Encompass
- `write_loan_field` - Update field values  
- `download_loan_document` - Download documents
- `extract_document_data` - AI-powered data extraction

**New Workflow Types:**

1. **Document Creation Tasks** (existing)
   - Document Analysis → Annotation → Drawing → Review → Export

2. **Encompass Document Processing Tasks** (new)
   - Field Reading → Document Download → Data Extraction → Field Update → Verification

3. **Testing Tasks** (new, temporary)
   - Test Setup → Field Read Test → Document Download Test → Data Extraction Test → Results Summary

**Testing Notes:**
- References to test data constants (TEST_LOAN_ID, TEST_LOAN_WITH_DOCS, etc.)
- Note that these are temporary and will be removed later

### 2. Updated `drawdoc_agent.py`

**Added Test Data Section (Lines 30-69):**

```python
# =============================================================================
# TEST DATA - Hardcoded test values that are known to work
# =============================================================================

# Loan ID for field reading tests
TEST_LOAN_ID = "65ec32a1-99df-4685-92ce-41a08fd3b64e"

# Loan ID that has documents attached
TEST_LOAN_WITH_DOCS = "387596ee-7090-47ca-8385-206e22c9c9da"

# Document ID for metadata tests
TEST_DOCUMENT_ID = "0985d4a6-f928-4254-87db-8ccaeae2f5e9"

# Attachment ID for download and extraction tests (W-2 document)
TEST_ATTACHMENT_ID = "d78186cc-a8a2-454f-beaf-19f0e6c3aa8c"

# Common field IDs to test
TEST_FIELD_IDS = ["4000", "4002", "4004", "353"]

# Sample extraction schema for W-2 documents
TEST_W2_SCHEMA = {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "employer_name": {...},
        "employee_name": {...},
        "tax_year": {...}
    }
}
```

**Updated System Prompt:**
- Added information about test data availability
- Mentions all test constants by name
- Agent knows these are pre-configured and working

**Updated Test Functions:**
- `test_encompass_tools()` - Now uses TEST_* constants
- `demo_agent_workflow()` - Now uses TEST_* constants  
- Both display which test data is being used

## Test Results

```bash
$ python drawdoc_agent.py --test-tools

Using test data:
  TEST_LOAN_ID: 65ec32a1-99df-4685-92ce-41a08fd3b64e
  TEST_LOAN_WITH_DOCS: 387596ee-7090-47ca-8385-206e22c9c9da
  TEST_ATTACHMENT_ID: d78186cc-a8a2-454f-beaf-19f0e6c3aa8c
  TEST_FIELD_IDS: ['4000', '4002', '4004', '353']

Test 1: Reading loan fields...
✅ Success: {'4000': 'Felicia', '4002': 'Lamberth', ...}

Test 2: Downloading document...
✅ Success: Downloaded 583,789 bytes

Test 3: Extracting data with LandingAI...
✅ Success: Extracted data:
{
  "employer_name": "Hynds Bros Inc",
  "employee_name": "Aliya Sorenson",
  "tax_year": "2024"
}
```

**All tests passing!** ✅

## Agent Can Now Be Tested Via Planner

The agent can now respond to test requests like:

```python
agent.invoke({
    "messages": [{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "Test the Encompass tools. Create a plan and run tests for reading fields, downloading documents, and extracting data."
    }]
})
```

The agent will:
1. Create a test plan using `write_todos`
2. Execute test phases:
   - Read fields using TEST_LOAN_ID
   - Download document using TEST_LOAN_WITH_DOCS and TEST_ATTACHMENT_ID
   - Extract data using TEST_W2_SCHEMA
3. Report results

## Test Data Constants Available

All constants are accessible in both the agent code and mentioned in the system prompt:

| Constant | Purpose | Value |
|----------|---------|-------|
| `TEST_LOAN_ID` | Field reading tests | `65ec32a1-99df-4685-92ce-41a08fd3b64e` |
| `TEST_LOAN_WITH_DOCS` | Document operations | `387596ee-7090-47ca-8385-206e22c9c9da` |
| `TEST_DOCUMENT_ID` | Document metadata | `0985d4a6-f928-4254-87db-8ccaeae2f5e9` |
| `TEST_ATTACHMENT_ID` | Download/extraction | `d78186cc-a8a2-454f-beaf-19f0e6c3aa8c` |
| `TEST_FIELD_IDS` | Field list | `["4000", "4002", "4004", "353"]` |
| `TEST_W2_SCHEMA` | W-2 extraction schema | Full schema object |

## Future Cleanup

As noted in the planner prompt, the testing capability is **temporary** and will be removed later. When ready:

1. Remove "For Testing Tasks" section from `planner_prompt.md`
2. Remove "Testing Notes" section from `planner_prompt.md`
3. Remove testing mention from system prompt in `drawdoc_agent.py`
4. Keep TEST_* constants (useful for development)
5. Keep test functions (useful for CI/CD)

## Benefits

✅ **Agent can self-test** - Can run tests when asked  
✅ **Known working data** - Test values that are proven to work  
✅ **Consistent testing** - Same data used across all test runs  
✅ **Easy debugging** - Clear test data visibility  
✅ **Documentation** - Planner knows what tools are available  

## Files Modified

1. `planner_prompt.md` - Added Encompass tools and testing workflows
2. `drawdoc_agent.py` - Added test constants and updated system prompt

## Linting Status

✅ No linting errors

## Ready For Use

The agent can now:
- Be asked to test Encompass integration
- Create a test plan automatically
- Execute tests using known working data
- Report results clearly

All while keeping test data separate from the planner logic!
